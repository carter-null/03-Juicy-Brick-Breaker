# Brick Breaker from Hell!
Project for MSCH-C220: Finished October 8th, 2020

Brick Breaker from Hell! is a basic brick breaker which gets its name from its punishing gameplay loop, ominous visuals, and hellish musical score. This game is made challenging by the constant shifting of its background colors, the unpredictability of the ball, and the constant raining of fake balls. While the player sinks into the game's nightmarish aesthetic, they will often find themselves losing track of the remaining bricks, as they are rendered temporarily invisible by the background for short periods of time. A column of fragments rain from the bricks at all times in order to help the player locate them when they are invisible. However, fragments only help so much. They reveal only the column where the bricks are located, not the brick's actual location. Moreover the player is constantly bombarded with a barrage of fake balls from the ceiling. These two elements, on top of managing a ball with its own agenda, work in conjunction to earn this humble brick breaker its name. Have fun, and beware of the Brick Breaker from Hell!
