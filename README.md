# Brick Breaker from Hell!
Project for MSCH-C220: Finished October 8th, 2020

Brick Breaker from Hell! is a basic brick breaker which gets its name from its punishing gameplay loop, ominous visuals, and hellish musical score. This game is made challenging by the constant gradation of its background colors. While the player sinks into the game's nightmarish aesthetic, they will often find themselves losing track of the remaining bricks, as they are rendered temporarily invisible by the background for short periods of time. Moreover, the slow moving paddle is also prone to brief lapses of apparent invisiability. The only way to see the paddle when it is invisible is to move it quick enough to stretch it out (with stretch enabled). The hue of the paddle changes briefly as it is stretched, which grants the player critical moments of visibility. There also exists a set of twin laser pointers that the player can be enabled at any time, implemented specifically for wimps! The lasers are a substantially differnet color than the paddle; thus it is impossible for the lasers to be invisiable at the same time as the paddle, greatly reducing the game's difficulty. Have fun, and beware of the Brick Breaker from Hell!
PS: For an even more challenging experience, enable full screen and try orienting the paddle with a misaligned cursor. Misaligning the cursor makes it impossible to cheat the game by simply hovering over where the paddle should be when it is invisible.

## Implementation
- Adding color to the paddle, ball, and blocks
- Stretching the paddle
- Streching the paddle changes the paddle's hue
- Camera shaking
- Original game soundtrack
- Original sound effects
- Particles when a block is hit
- Particles when a wall is hit
- Particles when the paddle is hit
- Blocks fall off the screen when they are hit
- A comet trail hangs behind the ball
- One-hundred particles circle the ball as it moves
- Twin lasers on the paddle point to where the ball is going
- Twin lasers on the paddle help orient the player (on easy mode, for wimps)
- The background of the game is constantly changing
- A border has been added to support the game in full screen
